(Edit this accordingly)

Steps to run:

1. Create build
2. Go to build
3. cmake ..
4. make voronoi_main (this is what you should convert to a class eventually)
5. run ./voronoi_main 
6. Enter image file path (absolute path with file extension)
7. Enter number of agents and starting positions (they should not be in the boundary themselves
8. Final image shown is the final division - try out with map1 and see if you are getting problems
