(Edit this accordingly)

Steps to run:

1. Create build
2. Go to build
3. make ..
4. make voronoi_main (this is what you should convert to a class eventually)
5. run ./voronoi_main "image_file_name" "number of agents" 
6. Final image shown is the final division - try out with map1 and see if you are getting problems
